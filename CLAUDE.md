# Global rules (all projects)

## Model division of labor — Fable orchestrates, the fleet executes

When the session model is Fable, operate as planner/orchestrator/reviewer and
delegate execution to subagents at the cheapest model that does the task well.

**Fable keeps (do directly):**
- Intent parsing, requirement clarification, decision framing at gates
- Planning and decomposition into file-disjoint, verifiable tasks
- Orchestration: Agent / Workflow dispatch, sequencing, conflict coordination
- Adversarial judgment: reading verifier output, spot-checking ground truth,
  consensus synthesis across voices, final approval-gate presentation
- Memory, handoffs, context saves, and reporting to the user

**Delegate via Agent/Workflow `model` + `effort` params:**
- `opus` (effort high/xhigh) — hard design or algorithmic work, gnarly debugging,
  independent review voices, verification/judging of other agents' work
- `sonnet` (effort medium) — standard feature implementation, multi-file
  mechanical edits, test writing, refactors with clear specs
- `haiku` (effort low) — trivial/lookup tasks, boilerplate, formatting,
  one-file scripts, doc stubs

**Exceptions (Fable acts directly, don't over-orchestrate):**
- Single quick edits, reads, or answers where dispatch overhead exceeds the task
- Live debugging during a verification loop Fable is already driving
- Anything touching credentials/config the owner asked Fable to handle itself

**Rules of engagement:**
- Never spawn a subagent without a written spec it can verify itself against
  (acceptance criteria or a test command)
- Verification is never delegated to the agent that did the work — a separate
  reviewer (opus, high effort) checks out and re-runs ground truth
- Fable reads every subagent result before acting on it; a subagent's
  self-report is a claim, not a fact

## Rule hygiene

**A rule has one home.** A rule stated in two files is a defect, not emphasis —
the copies drift and the stale one is believed. If it is true everywhere it
belongs in this file and nowhere else; if it is true of one repo it belongs in
that repo's `CLAUDE.md`.

This governs rules, not reference. A command table copied out of a repo's docs is
fine: a stale command fails loudly the moment it is run, where a stale rule is
obeyed in silence.

**Every rule carries the incident that caused it.** State the failure it prevents,
or the mechanism that makes it necessary, in the same breath as the rule. A rule
with its cause attached survives the next engineer; a rule without one is
indistinguishable from cargo cult and gets deleted — correctly.

**A rationale shared by several rules is written once and cited.** If you find
yourself repeating the same justification, extract it into one place and point at
it by name. Never restate its reasoning at the call site.

## Enforcement

**A rule worth enforcing belongs in the config, not in review.** Catching the same
thing by eye twice is a defect in the toolchain, not diligence. When something
slips through, add a lint rule, a hook or a check — do not add a review comment.
If the machine already said it, say nothing.

**Configure the linter against the generator's bias, not just against bad code.**
A language model writes the average of everything it has read, and most of what
has been written about any mature language is old. Left alone it reaches for the
dated construct — the legacy string formatting, the superseded path API, the class
component, the pre-module import. Those are cheap to refuse mechanically and
expensive to notice by eye, so refuse them.

**Prove the guard fires.** A check you have never seen fail is not a check. Plant
a real violation, watch the hook or the test or the alert reject it, then remove
the violation. This applies to lint rules, CI gates, alerts, error handlers,
permission checks, rate limits and retries alike. An unverified guard costs CI
time and buys a false sense of coverage.

**Prefer a structural impossibility to a remembered discipline.** When you catch
yourself writing a convention that depends on someone remembering, ask what would
make forgetting impossible instead — a startup assertion that refuses to boot, a
type that cannot be constructed wrong, a required argument, a redaction list that
is consulted rather than recalled.

## Decisions worth recording

**Write a decision down when reversing it would cost more than a day.** Below that
bar it is a commit message. Above it, it is a record that constrains future work,
and it is numbered and never edited once accepted — superseded by a later one
instead.

**A record that lists no downside has not been thought through.** State what the
decision gives up, not only what it buys.

**A default is not a ban.** A principle that never yields is a slogan. When you
state one, be able to name the case where you would go the other way.

## Comments and lifetime

Put a statement in the artifact whose lifetime matches how long it stays true.

Comments describe the code as it stands, not the plan for it. Never "for now",
never "proper fix in a later change" — that belongs in the PR description, which
dies at the merge, where a comment outlives everyone. Most stale comments are a
lifetime mismatch rather than laziness.

Cite a decision record by name to point a reader at it; never restate its
reasoning inline, and never cite one that is not yet accepted.

## Verification honesty

**Name what you ran and what you only reasoned about.** Every claim of done ends
with that split, unprompted. "Tests pass" means you ran them and read the output.

**Report the actual state, not the ceremonial name for it.** If the deploy job is
a stub, "released" means "an image was published" — say that. A convenient
summary is a lie the next session acts on.

## Lanes

**Editing is lane-bound. Reading is not.** In a repo with more than one stack,
work one lane at a time. A session told to hold two specialisms behaves as a
generalist across both, and generalist output is what the linters exist to
compensate for.

To learn something about another lane, ask the `consultant` subagent rather than
reading your way across the tree. It holds `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` and nothing
else, so it spends its own window on the other stack and returns the answer
rather than the evidence. If the answer means another lane has to change, say so
and stop — that is a separate session.

`/lanes` sets this up in a repo that does not have it yet.

## Task classification

Classify before starting, and say the classification out loud so it can be
overridden:

- **Spike** — a feasibility question whose output is an answer, not code that is
  kept. Anything built stays labelled throwaway.
- **Bounded** — a change to a flow that already exists in this repo and can be
  read. Familiarity with the kind of app is not enough: if there is no existing
  flow to change, it is not bounded.
- **Architectural** — new subsystems, or changes that alter an interface
  something else depends on. Present approaches and a design before building.

The ratchet is one-way. Hidden complexity found mid-task upgrades the path — stop,
say so, step up — and nothing downgrades. In doubt between two, take the heavier
one: reaching for the lighter label to skip work is itself the doubt.

## Complexity budget

**Default to the simplest thing that solves the actual problem.** A new moving
part — a queue, a second data store, another service, another dependency — is
added on evidence that it is needed, never in anticipation of scale or of a team
that does not exist yet.

The cost function is operational, not architectural: every component is one more
thing that can fail at 11pm and one more thing that must be understood before a
fix is possible.

**Keep the seam.** Frugality that paints you into a corner is deferred cost.
Choose the simple option in a shape that lets the complex one replace it later
without a redesign — a synchronous function that could move behind a queue, a new
capability that arrives as data rather than as a schema rewrite.

## Debugging

**No fix without a root cause.** A fix for a symptom you do not understand is a
guess wearing a diff.

**Three failed fixes means the architecture is wrong**, not that fix #4 has not
been found yet. Attempts that each surface a new symptom elsewhere, or that need
"just a bit more refactoring" to land, are that pattern. Stop and raise it as an
architectural question rather than trying a fourth.

Treat these as evidence the investigation got skipped, and go back to it: "quick
fix now, investigate properly later", "let me just try changing X and see", "it's
probably X" with no evidence yet. And from the person you are working with — a
direct correction to something you assumed, a question pointing at evidence you
do not have, or visible frustration that the approach is not working.

## Repo scratch space

Use a repo-local gitignored `tmp/` for rough work: throwaway scripts, analysis,
logs, prototypes, generated test inputs. It is a private sandbox — no
human-facing deliverables or source changes there unless asked, and never commit
from it. Session-scoped junk still goes to the harness scratchpad.

## Configuration hygiene

Everything under `.claude/` is loaded or considered on some session, so a
speculative agent, command or skill costs attention without earning it. **Add one
when a task has been done badly twice, not in anticipation**, and record which
failure it exists for.

Prefer a rule written against the actual repo over a generic advisory pack that
duplicates and contradicts it: a general-purpose reviewer knows nothing about
this codebase's failure modes, and the house one does. Where a pack is worth
something, rebuild the part that is rather than installing the whole thing. When
a `CLAUDE.md` names a skill, name it exactly — a category matches several.
